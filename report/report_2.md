- **Categorical Frequency Summary**: Provided an overview of distribution across major categorical features.

---

### Categorical Feature Cleaning & Normalization

- **Column Standardization**:
  - `make` was mapped to its corresponding `country` (e.g., Ford ‚Üí United States).
  - `body` types were grouped into body groups (e.g., coupe, sedan ‚Üí Sedans and Coupes).
- **Text Normalization**:
  - Cleaned inconsistencies in `color` and `interior` columns (e.g., standardizing casing, removing whitespace).
  - Transmission values (e.g., 'A', 'Automatic') were encoded as binary.

---

### Outlier Detection

Box Plot Insights: Vehicle Features & Selling Price

1. **Model Year & Condition**
- **`year`**: Most vehicles are manufactured between **2010‚Äì2014**, with a few **older outliers** (pre-2000).
- **`condition`**: Fairly **evenly distributed**, centered around average values. No major outliers, suggesting condition scores are relatively stable across vehicles.

2. **Odometer**
- Shows a **heavily right-skewed** distribution.
- **Outliers above 300,000 miles** are prevalent, with some extreme values exceeding **900,000+ miles**.
- Consider **capping or trimming** the top 1% to reduce skewness and improve model robustness.

3. **MMR (Market-Based Reference Price)**
- Dominated by outliers above **$75,000**, with a long right tail.
- This feature likely represents **industry reference benchmarks** but contains values far beyond the majority.
- Consider applying **log transformation** or **capping** at a reasonable upper bound (e.g., 99th percentile).

4. **Selling Price**
- Highly **right-skewed** with numerous **extreme outliers** above **$100,000** and even **$200,000+**.
- Consider applying **log transformation** or **capping** at a reasonable upper bound (e.g., 99th percentile).

>Proposed Action Plan
>
>Apply **outlier treatment (e.g., quantile-based trimming)** or **transformation (e.g., log)** to `odometer`, `mmr`, and `sellingprice` to enhance model training and interpretability.


![Boxplots of Numerical Features](../visualizations/Boxplots_of_Numerical_Features.png)

**Insights:**

- **Odometer**, **MMR**, and **Selling Price** exhibit strong right-skewed distributions with substantial outliers.
- **Year** and **Condition** show relatively symmetric distributions with fewer extreme values.
- Visualizing these helps determine which variables need capping to improve model robustness.

---

### Outlier Summary (IQR-based Detection)

**Outlier Count and Percentage per Feature:**

- **mmr**: 2,523 outliers (0.56%)
- **sellingprice**: 2,361 outliers (0.52%)
- **odometer**: 424 outliers (0.09%)
- **year**: 0 outliers (0.00%)
- **condition**: 0 outliers (0.00%)

**Selected Features for Treatment**:  
`['mmr', 'sellingprice', 'odometer']`

**Key Insights:**

- Although **mmr** and **sellingprice** exhibit long tails, their outlier rates are under 1%, implying they are rare but potentially impactful.
- **odometer** has fewer outliers, yet these can still distort model training.
- **year** and **condition** are clean and stable with no detected outliers.

**Actionable Plan:**

- Either **retain** the outliers when using robust models (e.g., Gradient Boosting), or  
- Apply **capping** (e.g., 1st‚Äì99th percentile) to minimize the influence of extreme values and enhance model generalizability.

---

### Apply Capping to Selected Columns

#### Applied Method: 1st‚Äì99th Percentile Capping

To address extreme outliers without sacrificing data completeness, I applied **percentile-based capping**:

- **Method**: 1st‚Äì99th percentile capping  
- **Goal**: Limit the influence of extreme values while preserving all rows
- **Capping Applied To**:  `['mmr', 'sellingprice', 'odometer']`

#### Why 1st‚Äì99th Percentile?

- Retains **most data points**, ensuring downstream model performance is not compromised.
- Especially suitable for **right-skewed distributions** like price and mileage.
- Helps maintain **row count consistency**, which is crucial for dashboarding and time-based analyses.

#### Key Observations from Box Plots:

- **MMR and Selling Price**: Originally had long-tailed outliers, now capped to reflect more realistic market values.
- **Odometer**: Extremely high mileage vehicles (e.g., > 500,000 miles) were capped, improving scale uniformity.
- **Distribution Shape**: The core IQR structure remains intact, preserving meaningful variation for modeling.

**Outcome**:

- Outliers were effectively **capped** rather than removed.
- This approach **preserves row count and data structure**, ensuring minimal information loss while reducing the distortion from extreme values.
- Post-capping boxplots confirm that the majority of extreme outliers were compressed into the whisker range.

![Before vs After Capping](../visualizations/Before_vs_After_Capping_Boxplots.png)

**Takeaways:**

- After applying percentile-based capping (1st‚Äì99th percentile), extreme outliers are removed without distorting the core distribution.
- This transformation reduces the influence of rare but extreme values in **mmr**, **odometer**, and **sellingprice**, which is crucial for stable model training.

### One-Hot Encoding

To prepare the dataset for machine learning algorithms, I applied **One-Hot Encoding** to convert categorical variables into binary features.

#### Feature Engineering Steps:

- Converted `saledate` to datetime format and extracted **weekday** (`1‚Äì7`) as a new temporal feature.
- Replaced original columns for better semantic clarity:
  - `make` was replaced with `country` to focus on **vehicle origin**.
  - `body` was replaced with `body_group` to generalize **vehicle types**.

#### Encoded Categorical Columns:

- `body` ‚Üí One-hot encoded as `Cat_*`
- `make` (country) ‚Üí One-hot encoded as `Brand_*`
- `color` (exterior) ‚Üí One-hot encoded as `C_*`
- `interior` (interior material) ‚Üí One-hot encoded as `I_*`

#### Output:

- **Dummy columns** were cast to `int64` for full compatibility with ML models.
- **Final dataset shape**: e.g., `(451,244, 58)` ‚Äî includes all one-hot encoded features.

One-hot encoding expands categorical features into numeric binary vectors, enabling regression and tree-based models to capture category effects.

#### Final Encodings Summary

- One-hot encoding was applied to key categorical columns: `body`, `make`, `color`, and `interior`.
- Ensured all dummy variables were converted to `int64` for model compatibility.
- A new feature `weekday` was created from `saledate` to capture potential day-of-week effects.

Final cleaned dataset saved as: `one_hot_cleaned_car_prices_for_modeling.csv`

**Why it matters:**  
Consistent performance across categories is critical for business deployment. Uneven accuracy may lead to unfair pricing or business risk.

**How it connects to the data:**  
By segmenting results by vehicle body type (e.g., SUV vs Other) or brand origin (e.g., Japanese vs Others), we can analyze accuracy trends and residuals across subgroups.

**Expected outcome:**  
Insights into where the model performs best or needs refinement, ensuring balanced performance across vehicle segments.
























### 1. Variable Distributions

- **Vehicle Year**: Most vehicles are manufactured between 2007 and 2015, with a peak around 2012.
- **Condition**: While condition is numeric, it's not a typical 1‚Äì5 scale; values range widely, suggesting different rating schemes from various sellers.
- **Odometer**: Positively skewed; many vehicles cluster under 100,000 miles, but some outliers reach nearly 1,000,000 miles.
- **Selling Price**: Right-skewed distribution; majority of cars sold between \$5,000 and \$20,000, but luxury vehicles can exceed \$100,000.

### 4. Missing Data Analysis

- **Transmission**: ~11% missing
- **Condition**: ~2% missing
- **Body/Trim/Model**: Some inconsistencies and null values exist but affect <5% of entries

### 5. Outlier Detection

- **MMR, Selling Price, and Odometer** contain extreme values (e.g., prices over \$200,000; odometers close to 1,000,000).
- Outliers detected using IQR and capped at 1st‚Äì99th percentile range to reduce skew without removing rows.

### Summary of Key Findings

- The dataset is rich, but contains noise and outliers, which need careful preprocessing.
- MMR, odometer, and condition are strong predictors for price.
- Sedans and SUVs dominate the market, with SUVs commanding higher average prices.
- Japanese brands tend to show more consistent pricing behavior.
