- **Categorical Frequency Summary**: Provided an overview of distribution across major categorical features.

---

### Categorical Feature Cleaning & Normalization

- **Column Standardization**:
  - `make` was mapped to its corresponding `country` (e.g., Ford ‚Üí United States).
  - `body` types were grouped into body groups (e.g., coupe, sedan ‚Üí Sedans and Coupes).
- **Text Normalization**:
  - Cleaned inconsistencies in `color` and `interior` columns (e.g., standardizing casing, removing whitespace).
  - Transmission values (e.g., 'A', 'Automatic') were encoded as binary.

---

### Outlier Detection

Box Plot Insights: Vehicle Features & Selling Price

1. **Model Year & Condition**
- **`year`**: Most vehicles are manufactured between **2010‚Äì2014**, with a few **older outliers** (pre-2000).
- **`condition`**: Fairly **evenly distributed**, centered around average values. No major outliers, suggesting condition scores are relatively stable across vehicles.

2. **Odometer**
- Shows a **heavily right-skewed** distribution.
- **Outliers above 300,000 miles** are prevalent, with some extreme values exceeding **900,000+ miles**.
- Consider **capping or trimming** the top 1% to reduce skewness and improve model robustness.

3. **MMR (Market-Based Reference Price)**
- Dominated by outliers above **$75,000**, with a long right tail.
- This feature likely represents **industry reference benchmarks** but contains values far beyond the majority.
- Consider applying **log transformation** or **capping** at a reasonable upper bound (e.g., 99th percentile).

4. **Selling Price**
- Highly **right-skewed** with numerous **extreme outliers** above **$100,000** and even **$200,000+**.
- Consider applying **log transformation** or **capping** at a reasonable upper bound (e.g., 99th percentile).

>Proposed Action Plan
>
>Apply **outlier treatment (e.g., quantile-based trimming)** or **transformation (e.g., log)** to `odometer`, `mmr`, and `sellingprice` to enhance model training and interpretability.


![Boxplots of Numerical Features](../visualizations/Boxplots_of_Numerical_Features.png)

**Insights:**

- **Odometer**, **MMR**, and **Selling Price** exhibit strong right-skewed distributions with substantial outliers.
- **Year** and **Condition** show relatively symmetric distributions with fewer extreme values.
- Visualizing these helps determine which variables need capping to improve model robustness.

---

### Outlier Summary (IQR-based Detection)

**Outlier Count and Percentage per Feature:**

- **mmr**: 2,523 outliers (0.56%)
- **sellingprice**: 2,361 outliers (0.52%)
- **odometer**: 424 outliers (0.09%)
- **year**: 0 outliers (0.00%)
- **condition**: 0 outliers (0.00%)

**Selected Features for Treatment**:  
`['mmr', 'sellingprice', 'odometer']`

**Key Insights:**

- Although **mmr** and **sellingprice** exhibit long tails, their outlier rates are under 1%, implying they are rare but potentially impactful.
- **odometer** has fewer outliers, yet these can still distort model training.
- **year** and **condition** are clean and stable with no detected outliers.

**Actionable Plan:**

- Either **retain** the outliers when using robust models (e.g., Gradient Boosting), or  
- Apply **capping** (e.g., 1st‚Äì99th percentile) to minimize the influence of extreme values and enhance model generalizability.

---

### Apply Capping to Selected Columns

#### Applied Method: 1st‚Äì99th Percentile Capping

To address extreme outliers without sacrificing data completeness, I applied **percentile-based capping**:

- **Method**: 1st‚Äì99th percentile capping  
- **Goal**: Limit the influence of extreme values while preserving all rows
- **Capping Applied To**:  `['mmr', 'sellingprice', 'odometer']`

#### Why 1st‚Äì99th Percentile?

- Retains **most data points**, ensuring downstream model performance is not compromised.
- Especially suitable for **right-skewed distributions** like price and mileage.
- Helps maintain **row count consistency**, which is crucial for dashboarding and time-based analyses.

#### Key Observations from Box Plots:

- **MMR and Selling Price**: Originally had long-tailed outliers, now capped to reflect more realistic market values.
- **Odometer**: Extremely high mileage vehicles (e.g., > 500,000 miles) were capped, improving scale uniformity.
- **Distribution Shape**: The core IQR structure remains intact, preserving meaningful variation for modeling.

**Outcome**:

- Outliers were effectively **capped** rather than removed.
- This approach **preserves row count and data structure**, ensuring minimal information loss while reducing the distortion from extreme values.
- Post-capping boxplots confirm that the majority of extreme outliers were compressed into the whisker range.

![Before vs After Capping](../visualizations/Before_vs_After_Capping_Boxplots.png)

**Takeaways:**

- After applying percentile-based capping (1st‚Äì99th percentile), extreme outliers are removed without distorting the core distribution.
- This transformation reduces the influence of rare but extreme values in **mmr**, **odometer**, and **sellingprice**, which is crucial for stable model training.

### One-Hot Encoding

To prepare the dataset for machine learning algorithms, I applied **One-Hot Encoding** to convert categorical variables into binary features.

#### Feature Engineering Steps:

- Converted `saledate` to datetime format and extracted **weekday** (`1‚Äì7`) as a new temporal feature.
- Replaced original columns for better semantic clarity:
  - `make` was replaced with `country` to focus on **vehicle origin**.
  - `body` was replaced with `body_group` to generalize **vehicle types**.

#### Encoded Categorical Columns:

- `body` ‚Üí One-hot encoded as `Cat_*`
- `make` (country) ‚Üí One-hot encoded as `Brand_*`
- `color` (exterior) ‚Üí One-hot encoded as `C_*`
- `interior` (interior material) ‚Üí One-hot encoded as `I_*`

#### Output:

- **Dummy columns** were cast to `int64` for full compatibility with ML models.
- **Final dataset shape**: e.g., `(451,244, 58)` ‚Äî includes all one-hot encoded features.

One-hot encoding expands categorical features into numeric binary vectors, enabling regression and tree-based models to capture category effects.

#### Final Encodings Summary

- One-hot encoding was applied to key categorical columns: `body`, `make`, `color`, and `interior`.
- Ensured all dummy variables were converted to `int64` for model compatibility.
- A new feature `weekday` was created from `saledate` to capture potential day-of-week effects.

Final cleaned dataset saved as: `one_hot_cleaned_car_prices_for_modeling.csv`

**How it connects to the data:**  
By segmenting results by vehicle body type (e.g., SUV vs Other) or brand origin (e.g., Japanese vs Others), we can analyze accuracy trends and residuals across subgroups.

**Expected outcome:**  
Insights into where the model performs best or needs refinement, ensuring balanced performance across vehicle segments.

## Predictive Modeling

### Defining Functions: Model Selection, Validation & Comparison

I defined reusable functions to automate model training, cross-validation, evaluation, and comparison across multiple regressors. These functions help streamline the modeling workflow and ensure consistency.

- `evaluate_models_pipeline()`  
- `compare_and_select_best_models()`  
- `cross_validate_model()`
- `compare_and_select_best_models()`
- `save_model_with_params()`
- `evaluate_models_pipeline()`
- `SmartModelSelector` 

These tools support both baseline and tuned models, and provide metrics such as **R¬≤**, **MAE**, **MSE**, and **RMSE** for comparison.

---

### Feature Selection and Preparation

#### Data Checking and Reloading

Before feature selection, I checked the cleaned dataset to ensure all preprocessing steps were applied correctly and no transformations were missing.

#### Lasso Regression for Feature Importance

To select the most predictive features, I used **Lasso Regression**:

- Automatically penalizes less important variables by shrinking their coefficients to zero
- Helps improve generalization by reducing overfitting

Key steps:

- Standardized input features
- Used cross-validation to determine optimal regularization strength (`alpha`)
- Visualized Lasso coefficients to guide final selection

#### Final Feature Selection

Based on Lasso results and domain relevance, I selected the following 8 features for final modeling:

üîπ Selected Features:
1. year
2. Cat_SUVs and Crossovers
3. odometer
4. weekday
5. Brand_Japan
6. C_white
7. condition
8. mmr

These features, combined with the target `sellingprice`, form the final modeling dataset.
The final modeling dataset, containing the selected 10 key features and the target variable `sellingprice`, was saved as: final_selected_car_prices_for_modeling.csv

### Data Preparation for Modeling

#### Data Checking Before Selecting

To prevent data mismatch or loss due to session interruptions (e.g., in Colab environments), I reloaded and revalidated the final dataset before proceeding with feature selection and scaling.

This step ensured:

- No shape inconsistencies
- No unexpected missing values
- All selected features remained available and correctly typed

By doing so, I guaranteed a clean and stable base for downstream modeling tasks.

#### Manual Feature Set Selection (Optional Step)

Although the final modeling used features selected via Lasso and correlation analysis, I also implemented an optional manual selection step.

**Purpose:**

- To allow flexibility for modeling with alternative datasets or domain-specific feature sets.
- To provide a checkpoint where business logic or new hypotheses can guide feature refinement.

This step is especially helpful for experimenting with different feature combinations in future iterations or business-specific models.

#### Data Scaling & Train-Test Split

- Applied MinMaxScaler / StandardScaler to normalize numeric features
- Split dataset into **training (80%)** and **test (20%)** subsets with `random_state=42` for reproducibility

This dataset is fully preprocessed and feature-selected, ready for training and evaluation across various regression models.

#### Overview

To establish a benchmark and select the most robust regression model, I trained and evaluated six models:

- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
- HistGradientBoosting  
- LightGBM  
- XGBoost  

Each model was assessed based on training and test performance metrics, including R¬≤, MSE, RMSE, and MAE. The goal was to identify high-performing models that generalize well and avoid overfitting.


| Model                | Train R¬≤ | Test R¬≤ | Test RMSE | Overfit Gap |
|---------------------|----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| **LightGBM**         | 0.9764   | 0.9763  | 0.1539     | **0.0001**   |
| HistGradientBoosting| 0.9763   | 0.9762  | 0.1540     | 0.0001       |
| XGBoost             | 0.9774   | 0.9760  | 0.1548     | 0.0014       |
| Gradient Boosting   | 0.9756   | 0.9757  | 0.1556     | -0.0001      |
| Linear Regression   | 0.9746   | 0.9747  | 0.1595     | -0.0001      |
| Random Forest       | 0.9963   | 0.9738  | 0.1618     | **0.0225**   |

---

#### Test Performance Comparison (Bar Charts)

To visually compare model generalization on unseen data, I plotted four bar charts based on test set results:

![Test Performance Comparison](../visualizations/Model_Comparison_Test_Metrics.png)

**Observations:**

- **Test R¬≤**: LightGBM, HistGradientBoosting, and XGBoost show the highest explanatory power.
- **Test MSE & RMSE**: LightGBM leads with the lowest error, closely followed by HistGradientBoosting.
- **Test MAE**: All boosting models outperform linear and random forest in absolute prediction accuracy.

These charts reinforce the earlier ranking and help validate model consistency across different error metrics.

---

#### Performance Summary, Overfitting and Generalization Analysis

![Overfitting and R2 Comparison](../visualizations/R2_Overfitting_Comparison.png)

**Insights:**

- **LightGBM** and **HistGradientBoosting** show the best balance between accuracy and generalization, with minimal overfit.
- **Random Forest** achieves a high training R¬≤ but overfits significantly, as seen from the large test gap.
- **Gradient Boosting** and **Linear Regression** perform consistently with small gaps and stable R¬≤ values.
- **XGBoost** performs well, but with a slightly higher overfit gap than LightGBM.

**LightGBM** was selected as the most balanced and reliable model, offering excellent predictive power with minimal overfitting risk.

All models were evaluated using `SmartModelSelector` and `evaluate_models_pipeline()` to ensure consistent comparison and metric tracking across training and testing phases.


### Per-Model Fine-Tuning

#### Model Tuning and Selection Strategy

I trained and evaluated six regression models:

- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
- LightGBM  
- XGBoost  
- HistGradientBoosting  

All models underwent baseline training and multi-stage hyperparameter tuning (Halving Search ‚Üí Randomized Search ‚Üí Grid Search).  
However, to maintain clarity and focus in this report, I present **detailed analysis only for the top-performing models**, while briefly summarizing the rest in the comparison section.


#### Selected Models for In-Depth Analysis

Among all six trained models, three stood out in terms of both predictive accuracy and generalization performance:

- **Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)** achieved the **highest R¬≤ (0.9764)** with very low RMSE and MAE.
- **LightGBM (GridSearch)** matched GBR in performance while maintaining the smallest overfit gap.
- **HistGradientBoosting (HistGB)** demonstrated **excellent generalization** with the **lowest overfit gap (0.0002)**.

These models are selected for detailed interpretation in the following sections.

While Gradient Boosting delivered the highest R¬≤ score (0.9764), **LightGBM achieved nearly identical performance** (R¬≤ = 0.9763, RMSE = 0.1536, MAE = 0.1008) with one key advantage: **speed**.

- **Training Efficiency**: LightGBM uses a histogram-based algorithm and leaf-wise tree growth, making it **much faster** than traditional Gradient Boosting.
- **Scalability**: It handles large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for real-world production environments.
- **Overfitting Control**: The model maintained a low overfit gap (0.0008), demonstrating strong generalization.

Given its balance of **accuracy, speed, and robustness**, LightGBM is a **top choice for deployment and further optimization**.

### LightGBM Modeling Workflow

### 1. Baseline Model ‚Äî LightGBM Regressor

A baseline LightGBM model was trained with default parameters to establish a performance reference. Despite no tuning, the model achieved strong R¬≤ and MAE scores, confirming LightGBM‚Äôs reliability on this dataset.

- **Train R¬≤**: 0.9764‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ**Test R¬≤**: 0.9763  
- **Test MAE**: 0.1011‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ**Test RMSE**: 0.1539  

The following plot shows the model's predictions vs. actual selling prices:

![Actual vs Predicted ‚Äî LightGBM Baseline](../visualizations/LightGBM_Baseline_Actual_vs_Predicted.png)

**Insight:**  
Predictions align closely with actual values, clustering around the diagonal line. Minor deviations appear at extreme values but are acceptable at baseline.


---

### 2. Feature Importance ‚Äî LightGBM Regressor

Before hyperparameter tuning, a feature importance analysis was conducted to understand which features most strongly influence vehicle price prediction.

![All Feature Importances (LightGBM)](../visualizations/LightGBM_Feature_Importance.png)

**Insights:**

- **mmr (Manheim Market Report)** is by far the most influential feature, confirming its role as a key pricing benchmark.
- **condition**, **odometer**, and **year** also contribute significantly, aligning with expectations around vehicle quality, usage, and age.
- **weekday**, **color (C_white)**, and **origin (Brand_Japan)** show minor impact but may still capture niche effects or trends.

This analysis guided the refinement of the final feature set for tuning and final model training.

---

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning ‚Äî LightGBM Regressor

**LightGBM Hyperparameter Tuning Strategy**

To optimize the LightGBM model, I designed a **three-stage tuning strategy** to balance speed, accuracy, and model generalization. Each stage progressively refines the hyperparameters.

#### 3.1 Hyperparameter Tuning ‚Äî HalvingRandomSearchCV

To improve the baseline LightGBM model, I first performed hyperparameter tuning using **HalvingRandomSearchCV** for a coarse-grained hyperparameter search, which offers an efficient way to explore hyperparameter space with fewer resources.

This approach progressively narrows the search space by allocating more resources to promising configurations.

```python
lgb_halving_base_params = lgb_baseline_model.get_params()

param_dist_lgb_halving = {
    'max_depth': list(set([lgb_halving_base_params['max_depth'], 10, 20, -1])),
    'num_leaves': sorted(list(set([lgb_halving_base_params['num_leaves'], 15, 63]))),
    'min_child_samples': sorted(list(set([lgb_halving_base_params['min_child_samples'], 10, 30]))),
    'learning_rate': sorted(list(set([lgb_halving_base_params['learning_rate'], 0.05, 0.01])))
}

**Evaluation Result:**

| Metric        | Train        | Test         |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| R¬≤ Score      | 0.9767       | 0.9762       |
| MSE           | 0.0234       | 0.0237       |
| RMSE          | 0.1528       | 0.1539       |
| MAE           | 0.1005       | 0.1011       |

**Observation:**

- Model performance is nearly identical to the baseline, but slightly improved in RMSE and MAE.
- Overfitting remains minimal, confirming tuning stability.

This version was used as the starting point for further fine-tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.

#### 3.2 Hyperparameter Tuning ‚Äî RandomizedSearchCV

After identifying promising regions via Halving Search, I conducted a more refined search using **RandomizedSearchCV**. This strategy randomly samples parameter combinations from predefined distributions, offering a balance between search breadth and resource efficiency.

```python
lgb_random_base_params = lgb_halving_best_model.get_params()

param_dist_random = {
    'max_depth': list(set([lgb_random_base_params['max_depth'], 10, 20, -1])),
    'num_leaves': sorted(list(set([lgb_random_base_params['num_leaves'], 15, 63]))),
    'min_child_samples': sorted(list(set([lgb_random_base_params['min_child_samples'], 10, 30]))),
    'learning_rate': sorted(list(set([lgb_random_base_params['learning_rate'], 0.01, 0.05, 0.1]))),
    'n_estimators': randint(50, 300)
}

**Evaluation Result:**

| Metric        | Train        | Test         |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| R¬≤ Score      | 0.9771       | 0.9763       |
| MSE           | 0.0229       | 0.0236       |
| RMSE          | 0.1514       | 0.1537       |
| MAE           | 0.0997       | 0.1008       |

**Observation:**

- Slight improvement across all metrics, especially in MAE and MSE.
- Excellent generalization with minimal overfitting.
- Performance is now marginally better than both baseline and Halving models, supporting the effectiveness of this tuning stage.

Next, I proceeded with a final fine-tuning using GridSearchCV to further optimize the parameters.

#### 3.3 Hyperparameter Tuning ‚Äî GridSearchCV

To finalize the model, I performed an exhaustive search using **GridSearchCV**, building upon the best parameters obtained from the Randomized Search stage. This method tests all combinations within a tight parameter neighborhood to find the optimal configuration.

```python
lgb_grid_base_params = lgb_random_best_model.get_params()

lgb_grid_param = {
    'learning_rate': [lgb_grid_base_params['learning_rate'] * f for f in [0.8, 1.0, 1.2]],
    'num_leaves': [
        max(2, lgb_grid_base_params['num_leaves'] - 5),
        lgb_grid_base_params['num_leaves'],
        lgb_grid_base_params['num_leaves'] + 5
    ],
    'min_child_samples': [
        max(1, lgb_grid_base_params['min_child_samples'] - 5),
        lgb_grid_base_params['min_child_samples'],
        lgb_grid_base_params['min_child_samples'] + 5
    ]
}

**Tuning Highlights**

- Focused grid constructed around the best randomized parameters.
- Slightly adjusted **`learning_rate`** (¬±20%) to explore trade-offs between convergence speed and generalization.
- Fine-tuned **`num_leaves`** and **`min_child_samples`** to balance model complexity and robustness.

---

** Performance Summary (GridSearchCV Result):**

| Metric       | Value     |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Train R¬≤**     | 0.977140  |
| **Test R¬≤**      | 0.976347  |
| **Train RMSE**   | 0.151239  |
| **Test RMSE**    | 0.153610  |
| **Test MAE**     | 0.100805  |
| **Overfit Gap**  | ~0.0008   |

---

This final tuning stage yielded the most balanced performance in terms of **accuracy** and **generalization**, confirming **LightGBM** as the best model for the task.

### 4. Save and Restore
