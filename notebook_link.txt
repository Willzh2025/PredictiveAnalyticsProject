ðŸ““ Google Colab Notebooks (Instructions & Links)

Below are the Colab notebooks used in this project. Each notebook corresponds to a key stage of the predictive modeling pipeline:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Cleaning**
   - Includes data loading, cleaning (handling nulls, encoding), and basic visualization.

2. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Trains multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc.)
   - Performs hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and performance comparison.

3. **Residual Analysis & Feature Importance**
   - Analyzes prediction residuals to evaluate bias and variance.
   - Visualizes feature importance using model-based and permutation methods.

ðŸ’¡ To run:
- Open each notebook in Google Colab.
- Run all cells sequentially.
- Ensure required libraries (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `lightgbm`, `xgboost`, `joblib`) are installed in Colab if not already available.
