### 📘 Google Colab Notebooks (Instructions & Links)

Below is the Google Colab notebook used for this project, organized by major steps in the predictive modeling workflow:

1. **📁 Dataset Setup & Preprocessing**  
   - Covers dataset import, inspection, and initial cleanup.  
   - 🔗 [Open Colab Notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wIt18lFApKYCF4RjMVaVUPg5u4kyeB3i/view?usp=sharing)

2. **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics, visualizations, and insights on key variables.  
   - *(Included in the same notebook above)*

3. **🧹 Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**  
   - Handles missing values, outliers, encoding, and transformations.  
   - *(Included in the same notebook above)*

4. **💡 Business Analytics Questions**  
   - Formulates key business questions to drive the analysis.  
   - *(Written as Markdown cells within the notebook)*

5. **📈 Predictive Modeling**  
   - Trains and compares models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost).  
   - Includes hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.  
   - *(All modeling steps are in the notebook linked above)*

6. **📌 Insights and Business Interpretation**  
   - Answers key questions based on model outputs and feature importance.  
   - *(Summarized in final cells of the notebook)*

7. **⚖️ Ethics & Interpretability Reflection**  
   - Reflects on fairness, interpretability, and deployment risks.  
   - *(Included at the end of notebook)*
